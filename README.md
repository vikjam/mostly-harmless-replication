## Synopsis

A bold attempt to replicate the tables and figures from the book [_Mostly Harmless Econometrics_](http://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/) in the following languages:
* Stata
* R
* Python
* Julia

Why undertake this madness? My primary motivation was to see if I could replace Stata with either R, Python, or Julia in my workflow, so I tried to replicate _Mostly Harmless Econometrics_ in each of these languages.
